# Regular Expressions 1


# Regular Expressions in JavaScript
A Regular Expression, or RegEx, is a pattern used to match character combinations in a string. In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects. We'll start by giving some basic examples, and then explain the syntax needed to construct and understand RegExes in further detail.

### Creating a Regular Expression
A regular expression consists of a pattern string and, potentially, a flag specifying further detail on how the pattern should be matched. We construct regular expressions by using regular expression literals or RegExp class objects.


### Regular Expression Patterns
We generally construct RegEx patterns using the basic characters we wish to match (e.g., abc), or a combination of basic and special characters (e.g., `ab\*c or (\d+)\.\d\*`).

##### Regular Expression Literal
A regular expression literal is a RegEx pattern encosed within forward slashes:
```js
const re = /ab + c/;
```
> This RegEx above matches the character a, followed by one or more instances of the character b, followed by the character c.

##### RegExp Objects
We can write a regular expression string and pass it as an argument toi the RegExp construct:
```js
const re = new RegExp('ab+c');
```

### Flags
To create a RegExp object, we use this syntax:
```js
new RegExp(pattern[, flags])
```

To create a regular expression literal, we use this syntax:
```js
/pattern/flags
```

If specified, flags can have any combination of the following values:
* $g$: global match.
* $i$: ignore case.
* $m$: multiline. Trates beginning(^) and end ($) characters as working over multiple lines.
* $u$: unicode. Treat pattern as a sequence of unicode code points.
* $y$: sticky. Matches only from the idex indicated by the lastIndex porperty of this regular expression in the target string.

### Special Characters in Regular Expressions
* Character Classes
* Character Sets
* Alteration
* Boundaries
* Grouping and back references
* Quantifiers
* Assertions

### Character Classes
This is not a class in the traditional sense, but rather a term that refers to a set of one or more characters that can be used to match a single character from some input string. Here are the basic forms:

* Enclosed within square brackets. Specify the what you'd like your expression to match within square brackets; for example, [a-f] will match any lowercase a through f character.
* Predefined: These consist of a backslash character (\) followed by a letter. The table below shows some predefined character classes and the characters they match.

|Character | Matches |
|:--:|:--|
| ^ |	Matches beginning of input. If the multiline flag is set to true, also matches immediately after a line break character. |
| $	|Matches end of input. If the multiline flag is set to true, also matches immediately before a line break character. |
| \b |	A zero-width word boundary, such as between a letter and a space. |
| \B |	Matches a zero-width non-word boundary, such as between two letters or between two spaces. |


##### Grouping and back references
* (a): Matches a and remembers the match. These are called capturing groups.

* (?:a): Matches a but does not remember the match. These are called non-capturing groups.

* \n: Here n is a positive integer. A back reference to the last substring matching the n parenthetical in the regular expression.

##### Quantifiers
* a*: Matches the preceding item a, 0 or more times.

* a+: Matches the preceding item a, 1 or more times.

* a?: Matches the preceding item a, 0 or 1 time.

* a{n}: Here n is a positive integer. Matches exactly n occurrences of the preceding item a.

* a{n, }: Here n is a positive integer. Matches at least n occurrences of the preceding item a.

* a{n, m}: Here n and m are positive integers. Matches at least n and at most m occurrences of the preceding item a.

##### Assertions
* a(?=b): Matches a only if a is followed by b.

* a(?!b): Matches a only if a is not followed by b.

##### Working with Regular Expressions
Regular expressions are used with the RegExp methods:

* test
* exec

and with the String methods:

* match
* search
* split
* replace
